#Insurance Payouts

This application processes insurance claims. It adds to an array of five items using a constructor function.

It runs a for loop to iterate over an array of objects, using a first function to determine the percentage of coverage for a given person's medical visit. Then it uses a second function to apply that percentage to each patient's visit cost. It logs each patient's total payout to the console. Then it logs the total amount paid to all patients.

In addition, inside of the second function, it also creates a JQuery object, which contains a <p> tag, with the amount paid to each patient in it. It appends this object to the console, for each patient.

And finally, the html calls a CSS stylesheet which has one simple rule to underline all text inside <p> elements.
